# Multiprocess import with Memgraph Example 

This example demonstrates how to split your Cypher file into nodes and relationships and how to use multiple processes to load data efficiently.


## 🧠 What This Example Does

The script performs the following actions:

1. **Run cypher_file_splitter_script.py** - helper script to split pokec dataset into nodes and relationships and saving into sperate folder.
2. **Run multiprocess_import_test.py**
   - you should create proper indices before hand in this case it is:
      -`CREATE INDEX ON :User;`
      -`CREATE INDEX ON :User(id);`
   - this script first loads nodes than relationships and uses 8 processes for parallel import
